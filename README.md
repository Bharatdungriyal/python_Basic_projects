# Python Libraries Practice - Data Analysis Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects aimed at practicing and mastering the usage of Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. These projects focus on data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, providing a comprehensive learning experience for anyone looking to enhance their skills in Python for data analysis.

## Projects Overview

1. **Car Analysis Project (`Car_analysis_project.ipynb`)**
   - This project explores a dataset related to car sales and specifications.
   - **Libraries used**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
   - **Key techniques**:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Visualizing car specifications and sales trends

2. **Netflix Data Analysis (`Netflix Data analysis (1).ipynb`)**
   - This project analyzes Netflix content to explore trends in viewing habits, genres, and more.
   - **Libraries used**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Key techniques**:
     - Data wrangling and cleaning
     - Generating insights from Netflix content (genre distribution, release year trends)
     - Data visualization using bar charts, histograms, and more

3. **Corona Data Analysis (`corona Data analysis.ipynb`)**
   - A detailed analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on its global spread, death rates, and recovery rates.
   - **Libraries used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Key techniques**:
     - Time series analysis of COVID-19 cases
     - Country-wise comparisons of confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities
     - Line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for data visualization

4. **First Analysis Project (`first analysis project.ipynb`)**
   - A beginner-friendly project that introduces data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
   - **Libraries used**: Pandas, Matplotlib
   - **Key techniques**:
     - Basic data manipulation (sorting, filtering, grouping)
     - Simple visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the data

5. **COVID Report Project (`COVID_report_project_BS.docx`)**
   - A detailed report summarizing the analysis conducted on COVID-19 data.
   - While this document complements the `corona Data analysis.ipynb` project, it provides additional insights and a formal write-up on findings derived from the data analysis.

## Libraries Used
Across the projects in this repository, the following libraries are used extensively:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and handling structured data.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn** (in some projects): For enhanced data visualizations.
